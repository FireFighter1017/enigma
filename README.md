# Enigma Machine in javascript (console only)

This project was to support my son's project of building an enigma machine to encode messages between him and his friends on Discord's public servers.

The script can be used to encode strings or a single letter.
It is not designed to be used with a GUI.

For now it can only be used in console mode.

The rotors have to be declared using the 'rotor' class.
